# Starfield Streamdeck Profile

Created for Streamdeck 2.0

Who doesn't want a button control panel to control your spaceship?

I highly reccomend the Unofficial Starfield Ship Buttons icon pack [Here](https://marketplace.elgato.com/product/unofficial-starfield-ship-buttons-1ce279dc-2411-4cd5-8a69-966673b76378).

This profile only contains "Hotkey" actions from the "System" set of commands.
